# 22-Frontend-API

In this application I connect to a testing API, load the contents of the API.

I made several clickable buttons depending on the number of items, the number of users in the database i have got.
All dynamics of depending on the content that we're getting back. 
The user is also clickable, you can select the user information and send an update, keeping track of the new information in the console.
This is information ready for a PUT request to the API to update content on the server side.



Unpretentious style included!
